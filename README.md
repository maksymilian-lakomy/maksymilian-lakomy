# <center> Hi, I am Max ðŸ‘‹ </center>

I'm a frontend developer. Also I'm student of computer science.

## Free-time projects

### [Three.js Mapper](https://github.com/maksymilian-lakomy/three-js-map-vue-js-redo)

What is hiding under this ambigious name is a library that is designed for creating any map that you want from supplied _chunks_. Main goal of this project was to provide a sollution that will render hundreds of thousands markers inside a browser without big performance impact.

It was primarly written as a part of a development tool for [The Chronicles of Myrtana](https:/kronikimyrtany.pl/index_en.html) modification.

**This library is still under development.**

Stack: **`TypeScript`** / **`Three.js`**

### [Pokedex](https://github.com/maksymilian-lakomy/pokedex)

Once a recruitment task for Allegro - now a perfect and nice to an eye benchmark for my skills, that I like to look back on from time to time.

I'm currently rewriting it, mostly because of the ineffective API calls and the over engineered structure. You can find the pre-rework version **[here](http://pokedex.maksymilianlakomy.pl)** ðŸ‘ˆ

Stack: **`TypeScript`** / **`Vue 2`** / **`SCSS`**
